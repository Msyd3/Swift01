## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let userName = "Mohammed" // Declare a constant to represent the user's name, since it is unlikely to change
let userAge = 30 // Declare a constant to represent the user's age, since it is unlikely to change
var stepsToday = 5000 // Declare a variable to represent the number of steps the user has taken today, since it can change throughout the day
let stepsGoal = 10000 // Declare a constant to represent the user's goal for number of steps to take each day, since it is unlikely to change for a given day
var avgHeartRate = 70 // Declare a variable to represent the user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours, since it can change over time
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
